Prior to that, he was the editor of The New Republic, alongside predecessor Rick Hertzberg, winning three National Magazine Awards in his tenure. Adweek named him editor of the year in 1996. In 1995, he published his first book, “Virtually Normal,” a case for marriage equality. He testified against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 and toured the country campaigning on the issue. In 2006, he published “The Conservative Soul,” a critique of the direction of the American right in the new millennium. In 2007, he was one of the first political writers to champion the presidential campaign of Barack Obama. His cover-story for the Atlantic, “Why Obama Matters”, was regarded as a mile-stone in that campaign’s messaging. Sullivan calls himself a conservative still, is a practicing Catholic, but has been an enthusiastic supporter (and occasional critic) of Obama since 2007. Sullivan appears regularly on the Colbert Report and Real Time with Bill Maher on television and continues his weekly column for the Sunday Times. He lives with his husband and two hound dogs in New York City and Provincetown, Massachusetts." href="#">More</a>
