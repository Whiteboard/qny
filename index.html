Prior to that, he was the editor of The New Republic, alongside predecessor Rick Hertzberg, winning three National Magazine Awards in his tenure. Adweek named him editor of the year in 1996. In 1995, he published his first book, “Virtually Normal,” a case for marriage equality. He testified against the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996 and toured the country campaigning on the issue. In 2006, he published “The Conservative Soul,” a critique of the direction of the American right in the new millennium. In 2007, he was one of the first political writers to champion the presidential campaign of Barack Obama. His cover-story for the Atlantic, “Why Obama Matters”, was regarded as a mile-stone in that campaign’s messaging. Sullivan calls himself a conservative still, is a practicing Catholic, but has been an enthusiastic supporter (and occasional critic) of Obama since 2007. Sullivan appears regularly on the Colbert Report and Real Time with Bill Maher on television and continues his weekly column for the Sunday Times. He lives with his husband and two hound dogs in New York City and Provincetown, Massachusetts." href="#">More</a>

                        <h3>Why New York?</h3>
                        <p>Q is based in the belief that context determines mission. The climate in which the Christian gospel must go forward, is in a post-Christian society. New York City has long been an individualistic city, an escape for many, a destination for others. There is a constant drive to "make it," to be better than those around you, to fight your way to the top. For those that live in New York it's exhilarating, exhausting and yet fulfilling. There is no better place to consider what might be next for Christian faithfulness in today's world.

                        <h3>Who comes to Q?</h3>
                        <p>There are a few key characteristics we believe all of our participants possess; First, a desire to be informed and exposed to current culture and the conversations shaping our public discourse. Second, the desire to be restorers, faithfully bringing the love and creativity infused by the Gospel in whatever occupation they hold. And thirdly, they hold the view that it's a Christian responsibility to renew culture and promote human flourishing for all people in our society.

                        <p>Yes, Q is dependent on a group of volunteers who are most interested in serving alongside the Q team in order to make the gathering a reality. Due to the nature of Q and working behind the scenes to ensure a quality gathering, we can't guarantee much participation in the actual programming of Q, and, in turn, only look for those who are truly interested and willing to serve in making Q as excellent as possible.
